Feature: Direct SQL Query Validation
  NOT ALLOW MISMATCH

  Scenario: Send Direct SQL query to Database and Assert Returned Results (Example 1)
    Given I connected to the database
    Given the API endpoint is "https://dummyjson.com/products" and node is "products"
    When I fetch the api endpoint and extract data from node
    Then I write node data to database
    When I send the following query to database
      | SQL                                           |
      | SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM master_products |
      | WHERE category = 'smartphones'                |
    Then the following results return from database
      | count |
      | 5     |

  Scenario: Send Direct SQL query to Database and Assert Returned Results (Example 2)
    Given I connected to the database
    Given the API endpoint is "https://dummyjson.com/products" and node is "products"
    When I fetch the api endpoint and extract data from node
    Then I write node data to database
    When I send the following query to database
      | SQL                                                             |

      | WHERE mp.title IN ('Infinix INBOOK', 'HP Pavilion 15-DK1056WM') |
    Then the following results return from database

    Then the following results return from database match with test xlsx "src/main/resources/test_db_direct.xlsx" and output difference file "src/main/resources/difference_db.xlsx"
